The AMRIT Helpline1097 service aims to provide comprehensive support to individuals and families affected by AIDS, offering a range of services to effectively address their needs.

## Features

- **National Helpline (1097):** The service operates as a national helpline for AIDS-related issues, providing counseling and care to individuals and families affected by AIDS. It supports both inbound and outbound calls.

- **Actors:** The helpline involves two main actors: the counseling officer (CO) and the supervisor. The CO is responsible for providing information, counseling, and referrals to callers seeking help, while the supervisor oversees the helpline's operations.

- **Comprehensive Support:** The helpline offers several services, including:

  - **Information Service:** Providing AIDS-related information such as prevention methods, treatment options, and available support services.
  
  - **Counseling Service:** Offering callers the opportunity to speak with trained professionals who provide emotional support, guidance, and address their concerns.
  
  - **Referral Service:** Connecting callers with relevant healthcare providers, support groups, or organizations that can offer further assistance.
  
  - **Feedback System:** Incorporating a feedback mechanism, allowing callers to provide feedback on their experience with the helpline, helping to improve the quality of support provided.

- **Integration with Everwell System:** The helpline is integrated with the Everwell system. It accesses a list of beneficiaries who have missed medication doses for AIDS treatment. The helpline initiates outbound calls to these beneficiaries, collecting accurate information about missed doses, including medicine type, dosage instructions, phone numbers, and alternate phone numbers. Additionally, it inquires about the reasons behind missed doses. The updated data is then pushed back to the Everwell system, ensuring up-to-date information about beneficiaries and their medication adherence.
